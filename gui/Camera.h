/**
 * \brief Represents a camera in world space
 *
 * Camera class to assist in looking at the world by providing a view matrix
 * to transform from world space to eye space. Logically, a Camera encapsulates 
 * a position and three orthogonal vectors referred to as right, up, and forward 
 * (corresponding to the x, y, and negative z axes of the eye frame).
 * An invariant is maintained that the three vectors returned by getRight(),
 * getUp(), and getForward() are always unit length and are orthogonal.
 * 
 * A Camera also encapsulates a standard perspective projection given by
 * a vertical field of view (fovY), aspect ratio, and near and far clipping
 * planes.  
 * 
 * The camera supports 3 different
 * types of control depending on the methods used to update it.
 *
 * 1. Using the MoveForward/Backward/etc methods along with the LookUp/Down/etc
 *    methods provides a free-look camera in similar style to FPS games.
 *    Looking up and down always takes the world-up vector into account to
 *    ensure the camera never rolls.  That is, the camera's right vector
 *    always remains orthogonal to the world up vector.  This invariant
 *    is only maintained as long as NO calls are made to the Pitch/Head/Roll 
 *    methods.  Otherwise, the results are undefined.
 *
 * 2. Using the Pitch/Head/Roll methods provides a space flight simulator like
 *    camera, in which the camera is free to rotate in any direction.  There is
 *    no feel for which direction is the world up.  These methods should not
 *    be mixed with the MoveForward/Backward methods.
 *
 * 3. Using the Orbit methods provides a trackball like control in which the
 *    camera moves around the scene on a sphere.  Using the OrbitUp/Down methods
 *    corresponds to changing the polar component of the camera's position in
 *    spherical coordinates, while using the OrbitLeft/Right corresponds to
 *    changing the azimuthal component.  Use MoveForward/Backward to bring the
 *    camera closer or further away from the orbit point, essentially increasing
 *    or decreasing the orbit distance, i.e., the radial component in spherical 
 *    coordinates.
